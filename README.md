Plus+ Platinum Ultimate AD-free version, which can be obtained after joining the
cult. Though, science has proven that the normal AD-free version is sufficient
for most people. In fact, the majority of people surveyed are annoyed by the
glare, while the rest showed a little interest)

## Install

### Prebuilt Executables

We offer prebuilt ready-to-run programs (called executables) for a handful of
popular platforms in the [Releases] section. You might find one built for your
platform there.

Please aware that these executables are generated by an unsupervised automatic
procedure, and we (as the authors and contributors) cannot guarantee to test
them. If you've encountered unusual failure caused by those executables, feel
free to open an issue, so we can take a look.

[releases]: https://github.com/nirui/sshwifty/releases

### Docker Image (recommended)

Deploying Sshwifty as a [Docker] container allows you to isolate Sshwifty from the
rest of the system for better system organization and security.

We also offer prebuilt Docker Images for few selected platforms generated in the
same way as we generate the prebuilt Executables described above. To deploy one
on your Docker host, run:

```shell
$ docker run --detach \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --publish 8182:8182 \
  --name sshwifty \
  niruix/sshwifty:latest
```

(Note: it's `niruix/sshwifty` with an `x`)

This will open port `8182` on the Docker host to accept traffic from all
clients (including remote ones), and serve them with the Sshwifty instance
just created.

To expose Sshwifty locally only to the Docker host, change the line
`--publish 8182:8182` from the command above to `--publish 127.0.0.1:8182:8182`.
This is useful for scenarios where you want to force remote clients to access
Sshwifty only though a reverse proxy, or just simply want to prevent remote
access.

When TLS is desired and you don't want to setup Docker Volumes, you can use
`SSHWIFTY_DOCKER_TLSCERT` and `SSHWIFTY_DOCKER_TLSCERTKEY` environment variables
to import certificate files to the container and automatically apply them:

```shell
$ openssl req \
  -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout domain.key -x509 -days 90 -out domain.crt
$ docker run --detach \
  --restart always \
  --publish 8182:8182 \
  --env SSHWIFTY_DOCKER_TLSCERT="$(cat domain.crt)" \
  --env SSHWIFTY_DOCKER_TLSCERTKEY="$(cat domain.key)" \
  --name sshwifty \
  niruix/sshwifty:latest
```

The `domain.crt` and `domain.key` in the command above is the location of valid
X509 certificate and key file.

Though, in most situations where a reverse proxy and/or load balancer (for
example, [Nginx] or [Traefik]) is used in front of Sshwifty instances, TLS should
usually terminate on the proxy, not on the individual Sshwifty instances.

### Compile from source code (recommended for developers)

The following tools are required in order to compile the software from source
code:

- `git` to download the source code
- `node` and `npm` to build front-end application
- `go` to build back-end application

To start the build process, run:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/nirui/sshwifty
$ cd sshwifty
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

When done, you can find the newly generated `sshwifty` binary under current
working directory.

Notice: `Dockerfile` contains the entire build procedure of this software.
Please refer to it when you encounter any compile/build related issue.

## Configuration

Sshwifty can be configured through either file or environment variables. By
default, the configuration loader will try to load file from default paths
first, when all failed, environment variables will be used.

You can also specify your own configuration file with `SSHWIFTY_CONFIG`
environment variable. For example:

```shell
$ SSHWIFTY_CONFIG=./sshwifty.conf.json ./sshwifty
```

This tells Sshwifty to only load configuration from file `./sshwifty.conf.json`.

### Configuration file option and descriptions

Here is all the options of the configuration file:

}
```

`sshwifty.conf.example.json` is an example of a valid configuration file, you
can make your own customization base on it.

### Environment variables

Valid environment variables are:

```
SSHWIFTY_HOSTNAME
SSHWIFTY_SHAREDKEY
SSHWIFTY_DIALTIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_SOCKS5
SSHWIFTY_SOCKS5_USER
SSHWIFTY_SOCKS5_PASSWORD
SSHWIFTY_LISTENPORT
SSHWIFTY_INITIALTIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_READTIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_WRITETIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_HEARTBEATTIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_READDELAY
SSHWIFTY_WRITEELAY
SSHWIFTY_LISTENINTERFACE
SSHWIFTY_TLSCERTIFICATEFILE
SSHWIFTY_TLSCERTIFICATEKEYFILE
SSHWIFTY_SERVERMESSAGE
SSHWIFTY_PRESETS
SSHWIFTY_ONLYALLOWPRESETREMOTES
```

These options are correspond to their counterparts in the configuration file.

Notice: When you're using environment variables to configure Sshwifty, only one
Sshwifty HTTP server is then allowed. There is no way to setup multiple servers
under this method of configuration. If you need to serve on multiple ports, use
the configuration file instead.

Be aware: An invalid value inside following environment variables will cause
the value to be silently reset to default during configuration parsing phase
without warning:

```
SSHWIFTY_DIALTIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_INITIALTIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_READTIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_WRITETIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_HEARTBEATTIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_READDELAY
SSHWIFTY_WRITEELAY
```

Please verify the value of these options before start the instance.

## FAQ

### Why the software says "The datetime difference ... is beyond tolerance"?

Currently, Sshwifty implemented a layer of obscuration in it's wire protocol.
The protocol utilize the common time of both endpoint to generate cryptographic
keys to be used to encrypt and decrypt traffic between the client and the
server. Thus both end must have accurate datetime relative to the time of the
world.

Please make sure the datetime on both the client and the server are correct by
resync them with a NTP server, and then simply reload the page. The problem
should be gone afterwards.

### Why I got error "TypeError: Cannot read property 'importKey' of undefined"

Sshwifty's wire protocol requires few cryptographic features which is only
available with WebCrypt API. Some old web browsers maybe not support WebCrypt
API, or the newer ones may disable WebCrypt API when the web page is not
accessed under [Secure contexts], which led to the error message.

[Secure Contexts]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts

Usually, setup HTTPS either on your reverse proxy or on Sshwifty itself should
allow you to access Sshwifty via HTTPS (a `https://` URL), and thus solving this
issue. Also, enabling HTTPS is mostly a good idea anyways, even in a LAN.

### Can I serve Sshwifty under a subpath such as `https://my.domain/ssh`?

The short story is No. Sshwifty was designed based on an assumption that it will
run as the only service under a given hostname, allowing web browsers to better
enforce their data isolation rules. This is very important because Sshwifty
saves user data locally, right on the web browser.

However, if you really want to put Sshwifty into a subpath, you can do so by
taking advantage of the fact that Sshwifty backend interface and assets are
always located under an URL prefix `/sshwifty`. You can thus redirect or proxy
those requests to their new location.

Keep in mind, doing so is really hacky, and it's not recommended by the author
thus no support will be provided if you decide to do so.

### Why I can't add my own key combinations to the Console tool bar?

The pre-defined key combinations are there mainly to make mobile operation
possible as well as to resolve some hotkey conflicts. However, if efficiency is
your first goal, please consider to use a software/on screen keyboard which is
specially designed for terminal.

And if that's not enough, connect a physical keyboard through Bluetooth or OTA
could be a better alternative. This way you can type as if you're using a
computer console.

## Contribute

This is a hobbyist project, meaning I don't have that much time to put into it, 
sorry.

Upon release (Which is then you're able to read this file), this project will
enter the _maintaining_ state, which includes doing some bug fixes and security 
updates. _Adding new features however, is not a part of the state_.

Please do not send any pull requests. If you need new feature, fork it, add it 
by yourself, then maintain it like one of your own project. It's not that hard 
with some Github features.

(Notice: Typos, grammar errors or invalid use of language in the source code and
documentation should be categorized as a bug, please report them if you find 
any. Thank you!)

Appreciate your help, enjoy!
